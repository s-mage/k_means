K-Means
=======

This is my third k-means, that finally should be well designed and implemented on matlab.

Current data model
------------------

* DataWrapper is the place where all external things as plotting, file reading
etc should be.
* Space is global set of objects
* Subset is one cluster in a Space. It's very usefull to get that class despite
the fact that subset is set too.
